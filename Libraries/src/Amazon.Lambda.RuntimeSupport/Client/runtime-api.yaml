#
#
# A note on error reporting in BYOL.
#
# Runtimes should report all errors using Lambda standard error format, in order to integrate with other AWS services:
#
# Content-Type: application/vnd.aws.lambda.error+json:
# {
#     "errorMessage": "...",
#     "errorType": "...",
#     "stackTrace": [],
# }
#
# Corresponding Open API 3 schema:
#
# ErrorRequest:
#   type: object
#   properties:
#     errorMessage:
#       type: string
#     errorType:
#       type: string
#     stackTrace:
#       type: array
#       items:
#         type: string
#
# Lambda's default behavior is to use Lambda-Runtime-Function-Error-Type header value to construct an error response
# when error payload is not provided or can not be read.
